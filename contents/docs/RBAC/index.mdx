## Roles

**MauManage utilizes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to define specific permissions and responsibilities for different user types, ensuring that each user has access only to the functionalities relevant to their role. This structure enhances security, streamlines workflows, and provides a clear division of duties within the application.
